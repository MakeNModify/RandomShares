# Pringles Grow

This is the setup I used for the 2025 Potplanter Pringles Grow contest.   
The idea is to grow "plants" inside a Pringles Can. The Roots may not exit the can. I mounted the setup on a bucket and addet a pump that connected via a hose to the supply piece.
## How it works
The idea is that the water with fertiliser is in the bottom and is pumped up to the spreader. For this you need a time or smart plug. You will have to figure out how much water you plant needs. For the media I used bims stone, but any mineral media should do.  
Print the "Filter" with 0 top and bottom layers and set the infill to a density and style so it works for you as a filter, that keeps the roots in but let's the water through. The filter can be glued in but does not have to.


## Was it successfull?
I don't know, the contest is still running (while writing this) and I'm just 4 days in. So far it looks good :P   
   
   
use at your own risk ;)
