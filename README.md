# RandomShares
This is an unsorted collection of mostly 3D Models I shared

Disclaimer:
These models are mostly not very polished since I made them quickly to solve a problem and were not intended for sharing in the first place ;)
Never the less, here they are, free and open source. If you want to do me a favore just subscribe to youtube.com/makenmodify - Thank you.

Most of these Models were made in FreeCad but with the Realthunders Assembly3 fork https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3 so if you want to edit them you might have to use his version.
