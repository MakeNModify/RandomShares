# RandomShares
This is an unsorted collection of mostly 3D Models I shared

##Disclaimer:
These were initially made to quickly solve a problem and not inteded to be shared when I initially designed them. I don't take any responsibility if you use them and something goes wrong.
This being sait the files are here, free and open source.
Most of them are designed in Realthunders Assambly3 fork of FreeCad. So if you want to edit them you might need to install it if you do not have allready. Here is the Link: https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3
