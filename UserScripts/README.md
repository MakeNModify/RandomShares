## Why these scripts
sometimes the internet can be an anoing place. For those cases scripts can make the world better :P I use the scripts with Firemonkey (for Firefox) but they should also work with Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey or what ever you prefer. 

## What are those monkeys
These plugins let you add user scripts, little javascripts, that alter the website you are visiting. They can be used for all sorts of things.

## My Scripts

### YouTube Original Audio Selector
I speak German and English. If I set my OS to English Youtube will default to a bad AI-duped Audio track on German videos the other way around if I set it to German. That is anoing me and others, but YT does not give us an option to default to the "original" track.   
This Script always selects the Audio Track that has "Original" in it's name - thats all
