## Why these scripts
sometimes the internet can be an annoying place. For those cases scripts can make the world better :P I use the scripts with Firemonkey (for Firefox) but they should also work with Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey or what ever you prefer. 

## What are those monkeys
These plugins let you add user scripts, little javascripts, that alter the website you are visiting. They can be used for all sorts of things.

## My Scripts

### AliExpress Price Per Piece Calculator
(tested with violentmonkey)   
When you want to buy multiples of something on AliExpress it becomes annoying to calculate the price per item.
If there are variants of something and the variant contains "3 Pcs" for example it will detect it and divides the price by the number and display the price per item in green next to the price tag. If it can't detect this it tries to find the amount in the title and does the same.


### YouTube Original Audio Selector
In the meantime there are extentions for Chrome and Firefox so you don't need that anymore I guess.
~~I speak German and English. If I set my OS to English Youtube will default to a bad AI-duped Audio track on German videos the other way around if I set it to German. That is annoying me and others, but YT does not give us an option to default to the "original" track.   
This Script always selects the Audio Track that has "Original" in it's name - that's all. Since I'm not great with JS I had some help from grok... I'm not proud of this but ChatGPT and Claude both failed so it is what it is.~~
