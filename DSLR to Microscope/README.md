#DSLR to Microscope

This is an adapter I made to connect my Canon EOS 500D to my trinocular microscope.
The microscope is a generic Chinese microscope you find on Aliexpress, like this one: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_APsNoL


It has on top an adapter ring that is held in place with a grub screw.
Take out that adapter and insert into the inner ring so the dove tail of the adapter is exiting the ring in the center. Then just reinsert the adapter into the microscope and tighten the grub screw.


I designed the outer ring to be used with an "58mm Retro Adapter" or "Reverse Lens Adapter" (since I had one laying around). These can be had cheap on Aliexpress https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ADkXOf or eBay.
Since its just a 58mm*0.75 filter thread really any camera can be adapted as long as you have the propper Retro Adapter.


The outer Ring has a hole for an M3 screw to tighten it in place.
The idea here is that you don't have to readjust this once the focus is properly aligned to your eye pieces, so it made no sence to make it more complicated.
